go-gdbm
=======

Go bindings for libgdbm, the GNU DataBase Manager library. In essence, this
package provides an API for managing simple string-based key-value stores with
a gdbm backend.

Installation
------------

    $ go get github.com/cfdrake/go-gdbm

Usage
-----

See `gdbm_test.go` for some code examples. The API is relatively reminiscent of
the C API, if you're used to that.
